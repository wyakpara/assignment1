  Assignment #1 - REMEMBER TO FOLLOW THE STYLE GUIDE

  1. Fork your own version of this repo
  2. Create a branch named <your-name>-assignment1 (in my case it would be mattbowytz-assignment1)
  3. Basing your code off of the below example, tell me a little bit about yourself

  <body>
    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!
